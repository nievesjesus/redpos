# What is redpos

Redpos is a test app to evaluate the use of an MVP design pattern with a Coordinator and the implementation of native tasks in ios.

For this, a methodology was created for the creation of the connection class that will work to solve all the main needs and also that it was compatible with different design and development patterns such as ReactiveDevelopment, MVVM, MVCN among others.

### External library

Redpos and this project in general use different OpenSource libraries to work correctly:

* [PureLayout](https://github.com/PureLayout/PureLayout) - PureLayout provides a fully capable and developer-friendly interface for Auto Layout. It is designed for clarity and simplicity, and takes inspiration from the AutoLayout UI options available in Interface Builder while delivering far more flexibility.

Other tools and technologies used to carry out this project and that do not have to do directly with the code, such as resources, web, video, etc.

* [Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/la/products/xd.html) - Used to create the user interface and export the necessary resources.
* [Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html) - It was used to edit and adjust the images and resources of the application.
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - It was used to create the Redpos readme.
* [Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/) - Main source for the icons within the application.


### Installation

You just have to open Redpos.xcodeproj and run

### Compile and test

Now run the application on the emulator or a physical device and try how easy it is to use Redpos. This app is adjusted for small and large devices, has been adjusted for iPhone SE and all subsequent devices (included iPad).

### Curiosities; type of programming

Due to the short time to develop the demo appp in this first stage a hybrid programming pattern between MVP and MVPC is implemented, to achieve a more persistent navigation flow, the app use and app coordinator.
